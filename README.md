Description:
This project implements an interactive "Expanding Cards" layout using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each card expands when clicked, creating a visually appealing and dynamic user interface.
Files:
index.html
Contains the structure of the page, including a container with multiple panels (cards).
Inline styles are used for the background images of each card.

style.css
Defines the visual styles for the layout, including responsive design for smaller screens.
Manages transitions, animations, and layout alignment.

app.js
Adds interactivity to the cards.
Ensures only one card is active (expanded) at a time.

How to Use:
Open the project in a browser by running the index.html file.
Click on any card to expand it. The previously active card will collapse.
For smaller screens (less than 600px), only the first three cards are displayed for better usability.
Features:
Smooth expansion animations.
Responsive design for desktop and mobile screens.
Dynamic user interactions through JavaScript.
